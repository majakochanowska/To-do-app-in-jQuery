# To do app in jQuery
NOT FINISHED YET 
The app will let the user to choose a company, en employee from this company and make table with tasks for chosen employee. A task includes a name and an amount in PLN which converts to EUR. All amounts in PLN and EUR are suming below a table. 

**Things to do and issues to resolve**
- Table with tasks should be made for chosen employee (now it's not connected with company and employee).
- Table shouldn't disappear on page reload (probably localStorage should be used).
- Columns in table should be sortable.
- It would be better if error message removed just after user corrects it, not after he/she corrects both inputs and presses the button.
- In Firefox the amount is invisible while typing in input (however it gets adding). 
- In Internet Explorer almost nothing works :/
