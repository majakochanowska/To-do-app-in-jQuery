# To do app in jQuery
The app lets the user to choose a company, en employee from this company and make table with tasks for chosen employee. A task includes a name and an amount in PLN which converts to EUR. All amounts in PLN and EUR are suming below a table. 

On changing employee, tasks are removed and the user can make table for other employee. It would be better if tables for selected employee were saved so user could go back to earlier selected employee and further edit his/her tasks, instead of doing a new one. It will be done later.
